🎬 Week 11 Project Completed – Netflix Login Clone (React + Backend Integration) 🔐⚛️

Excited to share my Week-11 project, a Netflix-style Login Page built using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and connected to a custom backend API built with Express.js. 🎨📡

This project helped me understand how the frontend communicates with a backend, how API requests work, and how authentication flows are structured in real applications.

Built as part of my learning journey at Error Makes Clever (EMC) using the EMC training flow, under the guidance of Agnel John (Founder & Instructor) and with support from Nandhini (Co-Mentor).

✨ Project Highlights :

✅ Netflix-style UI and design
✅ Email & Password login authentication
✅ Backend validation using Express server
✅ Error handling for invalid credentials
✅ Redirects user to Dashboard after successful login
✅ Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
✅ Environment-based API configuration
✅ Clean and structured components

🧠 What I Learned :

~ This project gave me hands-on experience with: 

Connecting frontend with backend API

Sending POST requests using Axios

Handling responses and error messages

Using React Router DOM for navigation

Storing and resetting form input states

Working with environment variables

Understanding basic authentication workflow

Deployment workflow using Vercel (Frontend) & Render (Backend)

This was also my first backend-connected project, so it helped me understand how real-world login systems work behind the scenes.

🧩 Tech Stack :

⚛ React (Vite)
🎨 Tailwind CSS
📦 Axios
🔗 React Router DOM
🖥 Backend API (Node + Express, Render Deployment)

📂 Pages Included :

🔑 Login Page :
~ User enters credentials
~ Backend validates input
~ Displays error if credentials mismatch

🏠 Dashboard Page :
~ Displayed only after successful login
~ Basic protected route flow showcase

⚙️ How It Works :

~ The frontend sends a POST request to the backend endpoint with entered email & password
~ If the response returns true, the user is navigated to the Dashboard
~ If the response is false, an error message is shown
~ Input fields reset after submission
~ API URL is configurable via .env (optional)
